    Each folder has 2 files, one with all of the LCs together, the other with them separated in sheets.

        I can separate them into independent files with some code real easily, but there's something wrong with the excel installation on this pc, if you can take a look.

    Each row describes a point on the transect line which is each 1m apart.

    The slope/curv/elev row is described as "Z".

    All the data is there, it just the excel that's being a bit annoying.
